Please make sure to write your code in accordance to the following rules:<ul> <li>When defining a method, enter a blank line before starting to write its body (except for methods with only one line of code, e.g. most getters and setters).</li> <li>Use a blank line to separate logical blocks of code within a method.</li> <li>Apart from those, don't use blank lines where they are not necessarily needed to keep the code compact and readable.</li> <li>Don't use blank lines after the last statement of a block, but a closing <code>}</code> with proper indentation in the next line instead.</li> <li>Don't use blank lines between two closing <code>}</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>You can use <code>//@formatter:off</code> and <code>//@formatter:on</code> to encapsulate code blocks that you don't want automatic code formatting to be applied to, e.g. because it would mess up readability. Please only use this if really needed and try to use proper indentation nonetheless.</li> <li>Separate code and comments, i.e. write the comment in a separate line before the statement that you want to explain.</li> <li>When you create new classes, please add license headers to them according to the Adding License Headers guide</li> <li>Commit messages have to be related to a specific issue on GitHub and reference its issue number as well as include a short description on what has been done in the commit.

While it is not mandatory, we heavily suggest to mark issues that you want to work on with the <code>approval requested</code> label and wait for one of the core developers to respond to the issue in one of the following ways. If you didn't create the issue yourself but picked an existing one, please also add a comment to indicate that you would like to work on it.</p> <ul> <li>The developer might request clarification concerning the specifications of the issue; please try to to answer their questions or extend the issue description and wait for their feedback.</li> <li>The developer might suggest changes to the functional or technical specifications to ensure that it fits the overall vision of the application; please confirm these suggestions or discuss them with the developer if you don't agree with them.</li> <li>The developer might approve the issue by adding an approval comment and removing the <code>approval requested</code> label. This means that we believe that the specifications are complete and the purpose of the issue serves the overall vision of SORMAS. At this point you can start development on the issue.</li> <li>The developer might ask you to pick another issue for development. This will usually only happen if the issue you have requested approval for is already planned to be developed by the core development team for the current or next milestone.</li> <li>The developer might reject the issue altogether. This will usually only happen if it doesn't fit the overall vision of the application at all or is a duplicate, and most of the time we will discuss this with you before closing the issue.</li> </ul> <p>The advantage of adhering to this process is that you can be sure that there won't be any major change requests in terms of functional or technical specifications once you've submitted a pull request containing your work, and that discussions concerning these topics can be led and finished before starting development.

Once a pull request has been submitted to our repository, a developer will either assign themselves as its reviewer or we will get back to you in case we won't be able to review it in time. This may e.g. happen if your pull request involves a lot of technical changes that we would like to merge together with other issues of the same nature or that could potentially break a lot of logic. Usually though, the general process looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>A developer assigns themselves as the reviewer of your pull request. Please wait until the review is done; if you think that the review is taking too long, feel free to add a comment to the pull request as a reminder to the developer.</li> <li>The developer might request changes to the code. If that's the case, please implement the requested changes or answer to their change request if you have questions or don't agree with a specific part of the request.</li> <li>Once you've implemented all requested changes, please request another review by the assigned developer by clicking on the \"Re-request review\" icon next to their name.</li> <li>As soon as the developer is happy with the submitted code (which might require multiple iterations of step 2 and 3, especially for larger pull requests), they will merge it into the development branch and close the pull request.</li> </ol> <p>Please adhere to the following principles when submitting pull requests:</p> <ol> <li>Only submit pull requests that are directly associated with ideally one specific issue in our GitHub repository. If there is no issue for the development work that you would like to do, create one before you start working on it.</li> <li>Link your pull request to the issue(s) that they are associated with. This can be done either by using the \"Linked issues\" section at the right side when viewing a pull request, or by adding the keyword \"Closes\" or \"Fixes\" followed by the issue number to the pull request description (e.g. \"Closes #61\").</li> <li>Make sure that your pull request has a meaningful title. By default, GitHub will use your commit message as the title which might not be appropriate. In general, using the same name as the linked issue is a good rule of thumb.</li> <li>Try to not use force-push when updating an existing pull request (e.g. after changes have been requested or because you need to resolve merge conflicts).</li> <li>Ideally, your pull request should pass the checks done by the automatic CI pipeline before it gets reviewed. If that's not the case, please make sure that your branch is up-to-date with the current development branch. If the checks also fail for the development branch, you're not required to do anything.

However, every country naturally has its own requirements and processes, and in addition, there is a set of information that needs to be specified before a SORMAS instance can function properly. For this reason, there are a number of ways in which such a SORMAS instance can be configured and customized:</p> <ul> <li>Server Configuration: The basic server configuration is available as a .properties file, needs to be adjusted for every SORMAS instance, and is relevant for both production and development. This should be edited directly after installing the server.</li> <li>Feature Configuration: Most SORMAS features are optional and can be turned on or off directly in the database.</li> <li>Disease Configuration: SORMAS supports a large number of infectious diseases which can be enabled or disabled and further customized directly in the database.</li> <li>Infrastructure Data: Most infrastructure data (except countries and continents) are not shipped with SORMAS because they are country-specific. Importing the infrastructure data of your country (or creating some dummy data) is one of the first things you should do after setting up a SORMAS server.</li> </ul> <p>Beyond that, the Wiki contains even more customization options:</p> <ul> <li>Adding Disease Variants to a SORMAS Server</li> <li>Customizing the Login and About Pages</li> <li>Customizing the Name and Icon of the Android App</li> <li>Creating a SORMAS2SORMAS Certificate</li> </ul>"},{"location":"SERVER_CUSTOMIZATION/#server-configuration","title":"Server Configuration","text":"<p>The general SORMAS configuration is stored in the sormas.properties file that you can find in your payara domain folder.

Each property has an explanation telling you its purpose, and some of them also have a default value that you can use to revert the changes you've made.</p> <p>Most of these properties are commented (indicated by a # in front of their name and value), which means that the default value will automatically be used (e.g. the path to temporary files on the server) or the associated feature will not be used at all (e.g. the custom branding properties or the configuration of an external symptom journal). Some properties however are not commented, but also don't have a default value. It is strongly recommended to enter values for these properties because they are required for some parts of SORMAS to work correctly, or because they are very specific to your individual SORMAS instance. This especially applies to the country.locale and country.name properties, which will cause serious problems while using the application if left empty.</p> <p>Important: The sormas.properties file contains all properties that existed in the SORMAS version that you initially installed on your server.
